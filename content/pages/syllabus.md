Course Description
------------------

This class investigates the use of computers in architectural design and construction. It begins with a pre-prepared design computer model, which is used for testing and process investigation in construction. It then explores the process of construction from all sides of the practice: detail design, structural design, and both legal and computational issues.

Course Organization
-------------------

*   Lectures
*   Assignments
*   One Final Presentation

Course Policies
---------------

1.  Students are expected to complete both the assignments to full completion for a grade.
2.  Assignments later than one week after the due date will loose one letter grade.
3.  Assignments will be accepted more than 2 weeks after the assignment date.

Assignments
-----------

There will be a total of 2 assignments plus one final project. Each assignment is broken into weekly goals.

Grading
-------

Due to the size of the class and the fact that we are working in teams your fellow classmates will have a hand in determining your individual final grade. Each team of four will individually evaluate the other three team members after the final presentation in December. Your final grade will be determined as a variation of the overall grade for the team. For example, if your team receives a B as the average grade for the semester and your teammates qualify you to have contributed to the team your personal grade for the semester will be a B+ or an A. If you slack off or minimally contribute to your teams efforts you will receive a B- or a C. Since everyone has a specific role to play on your team individual contributions should be evident at reviews. Please talk to us early if irreconcilable disputes occur we would like to address them sooner rather than later.
